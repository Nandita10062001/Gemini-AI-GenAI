# Gemini AI - Streamlit Integration

Gemini AI is an AI-based platform that integrates Google Generative AI models (Gemini) into a user-friendly Streamlit web application. This project allows users to interact with multiple models for various tasks such as chat, image captioning, text embedding, and question answering.

## Features

- **Chatbot Interaction**: A chatbot powered by the Gemini Pro model that responds to user inputs in real-time.
- **Image Captioning**: Upload an image and receive an AI-generated caption using the Gemini Flash model.
- **Text Embedding**: Convert textual data into embeddings for retrieval and document processing using Google's Text Embedding model.
- **Ask Me Anything**: Submit questions and receive AI-generated responses using the Gemini Pro model.



## Models Used

1. **Gemini Pro Model** (`gemini-1.5-pro`): This model is used for chat interaction and generating responses based on the user prompt.
2. **Gemini Flash Model** (`gemini-1.5-flash`): This model generates content from images, such as image captions.
3. **Text Embedding Model** (`text-embedding-004`): A model for converting text into embeddings for tasks like retrieval and document understanding.
