# Gemini AI - Streamlit Integration

Gemini AI is an AI-based platform that integrates Google Generative AI models (Gemini) into a user-friendly Streamlit web application. This project allows users to interact with multiple models for various tasks such as chat, image captioning, text embedding, and question answering.

## Features

- **Chatbot Interaction**: A chatbot powered by the Gemini Pro model that responds to user inputs in real-time.
- **Image Captioning**: Upload an image and receive an AI-generated caption using the Gemini Flash model.
- **Text Embedding**: Convert textual data into embeddings for retrieval and document processing using Google's Text Embedding model.
- **Ask Me Anything**: Submit questions and receive AI-generated responses using the Gemini Pro model.
